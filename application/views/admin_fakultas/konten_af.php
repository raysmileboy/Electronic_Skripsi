        Outdated Versions of SSL/TLS
      SSL went through several modifi cations since it was fi rst invented by Netscape
      in 1995.
      12
       The last version of SSL was 3.0 and since then it has been continued
      under the name TLS (Transport Layer Security) protocol. If a payment application
      does
      not
      use
      the
      latest
      and
      greatest
      version
      of
      TLS
      (1.2
      at
      the
      time
      of
      this

      publication),
      it
      is
      most
      probably
      vulnerable
      to
      attacks
      because
      each
      version
      of

      SSL
      and
      TLS
      included
      security
      patches.
      13
      Weak Cipher Suits
      One of the features of SSL is the ability to negotiate the type and level of encryption
      between
      client
      and
      server.
      On
      the
      one
      hand
      this
      feature
      is
      benefi
      cial
      because

      it
      allows
      different
      types
      of
      clients
      and
      servers
      to
      communicate
      with
      each
      other.

      On
      the
      other
      hand,
      this
      feature
      may
      allow
      an
      attacker
      to
      downgrade
      the
      level
      of

      encryption
      and
      tamper
      with
      a communication
      that
      is
      supposed
      to
      be secure.
      14
      Man-in-the-Middle
      Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) is one of the most famous type of attacks. It allows
      an attacker to seamlessly tap on-network traffi c between unsuspecting clients
      and servers and steal sensitive payment card data. The client confi guration can
      be manipulated so it establishes communication with the bogus server through
      a different host address and a server certifi cate that is valid for that address. If
      the client does not validate the host URL and the issuer of the server certifi cate,
      then it assumes it is talking to the legitimate server.
      Another possible scenario of a MITM attack is inserting a bogus proxy (an
      intermediary that transmits requests and responses between clients and servers)
      which
      intercepts
      the
      network
      traffi
      c
      between
      the
      legitimate
      client
      and
      the

      server
      using
      a fake
      server
      certifi
      cate
      as
      shown
      on Figure
      6-4.
      The
      bogus
      proxy

      establishes
      communication
      with
      the
      legitimate
      server
      and
      pretends
      to
      be a

      legitimate
      client.
      This
      can
      be made
      possible
      by
      several
      conditions,

        better understanding the world. This is not a new cultural trend; the
  Pythagoreans in ancient Greece had a similar ethic and subculture, despite
  not owning computers. They saw beauty in mathematics and discovered many
  core concepts in geometry. That thirst for knowledge and its beneficial byproducts
  would
  continue
  on through
  history,
  from
  the
  Pythagoreans
  to
  Ada

  Lovelace
  to
  Alan
  Turing
  to the
  hackers
  of the

  club.

  Modern
  hackers
  like
  Richard
  Stallman
  and Steve
  Wozniak
  have
  continued

  the
  hacking
  legacy,
  bringing
  us
  modern
  operating
  systems,
  programming

  languages,
  personal
  computers,
  and many
  other
  technologies
  that
  we
  use

  every
  day.

   How does one distinguish between the good hackers who bring us the
  wonders of technological advancement and the evil hackers who steal our
  credit card numbers? The term cracker was coined to distinguish evil hackers
  from the good ones. Journalists were told that crackers were supposed to be
  the bad guys, while hackers were the good guys. Hackers stayed true to the
  Hacker Ethic, while crackers were only interested in breaking the law and
  making a quick buck. Crackers were considered to be much less talented
  than the elite hackers, as they simply made use of hacker-written tools and
  scripts without understanding how they worked. Cracker was meant to be the
  catch-all label for anyone doing anything unscrupulous with a computer—
  pirating software, defacing websites, and worst of all, not understanding what
  they were doing. But very few people use this term today.
   The term’s lack of popularity might be due to its confusing etymology—
  cracker originally described those who crack software copyrights and reverse
  engineer copy-protection schemes. Its current unpopularity might simply
  result from its two ambiguous new definitions: a group of people who engage
  in illegal activity with computers or people who are relatively unskilled hackers.
  Few technology journalists feel compelled to use terms that most of their
  readers are unfamiliar with. In contrast, most people are aware of the mystery
  and skill associated with the term hacker, so for a journalist, the decision to
  use the term hacker is easy. Similarly, the term script kiddie is sometimes used
  to refer to crackers, but it just doesn’t have the same zing as the shadowy
  hacker. There are some who will still argue that there is a distinct line between
  hackers and crackers, but I believe that anyone who has the hacker spirit is a
  hacker, despite any laws he or she may break.
  The current laws restricting cryptography and cryptographic research
  further blur the line between hackers and crackers. In 2001, Professor Edward
  Felten and his research team from Princeton University were about to publish
  a paper that discussed the weaknesses of various digital watermarking schemes.
  This paper responded to a challenge issued by the Secure Digital Music
  Initiative (SDMI) in the SDMI Public Challenge, which encouraged the
  public to attempt to break these watermarking schemes. Before Felten and
  his team could publish the paper, though, they were threatened by both the
  SDMI Foundation and the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).
  The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DCMA) of 1998 makes it illegal to
  discuss or provide technology that might be used to bypass industry con-
  sumer controls. This same law was used against Dmitry Sklyarov, a Russian
  computer programmer and hacker. He had written software to circumvent
